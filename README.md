# Frame Cursor
 A small Blender add-on for the Oject Mode View menu that centers the view around the 3d cursor.

Apparently, you can [already do the same thing with Alt+MMB](https://twitter.com/abdoubouam/status/1526331445232410624?s=20&t=mb48r9Oln3epFtgmICnBxw). Blender also already has an option to center the view to the cursor under View / Align View, so this add-on is **doubly** unnecessary.
